# About the Project

Much like many in the gaming world, I am now a new fan of the Dungeons and Dragons universe. I built this site with two focus points in mind: to refresh and sharpen my skills in Python and learn some more about the DnD universe as I go.
Enter Roll for Info! A simple web-app utilizing the Dungeons and Dragons API to several endpoints that presents basic to in-depth information about some of the high level concepts and mechanics of the game and its inhabitants. I have plenty of additions in mind as wide as the Sword Coast. Feel free to check back in the future to see updates!
